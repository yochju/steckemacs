* Usage

*steckemacs* is an Emacs configuration that integrates around 60 modes (packages). Stock Emacs is not very useful and lacks many convenient commands. Over the years I've discovered many good extensions and added them to this setup. The goal is to keep everything in one file =steckemacs.org= (plus =.emacs= for the initialization) and not as many others to split it over lots of files and directories. Packages are retrieved from the Emacs package repositories on the internet on the first startup.

The source code is hosted on Github: [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
To use this setup please use Emacs 24.3 or later. Older versions might not work properly.
I had to tweak it quite a bit to load everything on the first startup, which is a bit problematic because I need the latest Org mode and the installed version easily conflicts with new version etc.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Installation

Change to a directory of your choice and clone *steckemacs*:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  cd <my directory>
  git clone https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs.git
#+END_SRC

And symlink =.emacs= into your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    cd ~
    ln -s <path to the directory from above>/.emacs
#+END_SRC

That's it. Then you can run emacs and it should pick up the config, install all the packages and make you happy ;)

** Keyboard shortcuts

By using the =key-chord= mode we can avoid having to type C- or M- all the time. It allows for using keys pressed simultaneously and I'm using it quite often.

When I write =fg= as a key combo it means you would have to press =f= and =g= at the same time.

I only describe my custom key combinations currently. To learn the standard Emacs commands, go through the Tutorial =C-h t=, use =C-S-h= or =M-x= to see/filter the available commands/shortcuts.

#+NAME: keys-doc
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :tangle no :results output raw :exports results
  (mapcar (lambda (l) (if (listp l)
                          (princ (format "| =%s= | %s |\n"(car l) (nth 1 l)))
                        (princ "|-\n")))
            keys)
#+END_SRC

This table is generated with an Elisp block =keys-doc= from an Org table which is also used in the code [[*Key%20Bindings][further below]].

** Contributions

I'm using *org-mode* to manage *steckemacs*. =.emacs= loads =steckemacs.org=, exports all the code blocks to =steckemacs.el= and loads that file to initialize Emacs.

You can find more information about *Literate Programming* and *org-mode* here: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming

If you want to help me out improving the config, fork the repo, create a new branch and open up a Pull Request so we can discuss the merge.

Of course you can also just [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs/issues][report issues]] :)

* Code

** Load Path

The variable =load-path= lists all the directories where Emacs should look for Elisp files. The first file found is used, therefore the order of the directories is relevant.

=load-path= is documented in the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html][Emacs Online Manual]], in chapter *Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs*. Useful tips are also on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][EmacsWiki]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((default-directory "~/.emacs.d/elisp/"))
    (unless (file-exists-p default-directory)
      (make-directory default-directory))
    (setq load-path
          (append
           (let ((load-path (copy-sequence load-path))) ;; Shadow
             (append
              (copy-sequence (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '(".")))
              (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))
           load-path)))
#+END_SRC

Here we create the directory =~/.emacs.d/elisp/= if it does not exist, add it to the =load-path= and also add all subdirectories. Doing that any =.el= or =.elc= files in these directories will be available to *emacs*.

** Online Check

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq stk/onlinep nil)
  (unless
      (condition-case nil
          (delete-process
           (make-network-process
            :name "stk/check-internet"
            :host "elpa.gnu.org"
            :service 80))
        (error t))
    (setq stk/onlinep t))
#+END_SRC

Try to open a connection to =elpa.gnu.org= and if it succeeds set =stk/onlinep= to true. We use this flag later for network related operations.

** El-Get

#+CAPTION: El-Get Logo
#+NAME: el-get-logo
[[https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/logo/el-get.png]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
El-Get is designed to simplify this process and allow access to all the various methods of obtaining packages from a single interface. Every package has a recipe that allows you to locate the original source, and that can be updated if the package is moved.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: Dimitri Fontaine
#+NAME: fig:dimitri
[[http://tapoueh.org/images/dim.jpeg]]

Dimitri (on the image above, [[fig:dimitri]]) is the clever guy that brougth us El-Get. The code is hosted [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][on Github]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")
  (setq el-get-install-skip-emacswiki-recipes t) (ref:wiki)
  (unless (require 'el-get nil 'noerror)
    (if stk/onlinep
      (with-current-buffer
          (url-retrieve-synchronously
           "https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el")
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (eval-print-last-sexp))
      (error "El-Get is not installed and we are unable to download it without an internet connection: cannot continue")
      ))
#+END_SRC

This sets up the load path and fetches and evaluates the stable El-Get branch if not already loaded (as described [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#basic-setup][on Github]]). In line [[(wiki)]] we make sure El-Get doesn't load all the Wiki recipes as we don't use them.

                            (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages)))
          (:name php-align

          ))
#+END_SRC

These are simple El-Get recipes that will either fetch single Elisp files or clone a Git repo. The =ob-php= recipe uses a neat El-Get feature that allows to do some preparation after the installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
  (setq my-el-get-packages
        (append
         '()
         (mapcar 'el-get-source-name el-get-sources)))

  (when stk/onlinep
    (el-get 'sync my-el-get-packages) (ref:sync)
    (add-to-list 'after-init-hook (lambda () (el-get-update-all t))))
#+END_SRC

The sync function expects the package names which are extracted from =el-get-sources=. In line [[(sync)]] El-Get does the magic and gets the packages specified in =el-get-sources=. After that we instruct the =after-init-hook= to update all El-Get packages. Hooks are variables containing a list of functions that are executed when the specific hook is run, in this case after the init file has finished loading. El-Get would stall the init when I tried updating the packages at this point so I had to defer that.

** Packages

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))
#+END_SRC

This adds two remote package repositories. The repo from the FSF is already included in Emacs 24 (see http://elpa.gnu.org/).

[[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] is run by Nic Ferrier who wrote the Emacs webserver [[http://elnode.org/][Elnode]]. Some packages are slightly outdated but it's still a useful resource.

The best repository by far is [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. It builds packages directly from upstream source code. There's a nice [[https://twitter.com/melpa_emacs][Twitter Feed]] showing the packages that have been updated, which is great to discover new modes.

#+END_SRC

Quite a big list of packages. When Emacs starts up the first time it takes quite a while to install all of them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when stk/onlinep
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (mapcar 'package-install
            (loop for p in my-packages
                  unless (package-installed-p p) collect p)))
#+END_SRC

This part first checks if there is an internet connection. If true it refreshes the package archive cache and goes on to install all the packages that are not yet installed.

** Key Bindings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my-keys-minor-mode-map (make-keymap) "my-keys-minor-mode keymap.")
#+END_SRC

This is a custom keymap. It is used for a [[my-keys-minor-mode][minor mode that is activated at the end]]. This is the only way I know of to make sure no other minor modes to these override special keys. Setting a global key will not suffice.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (key-chord-mode 1)
  (setq key-chord-two-keys-delay 0.03)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Key-chord lets you bind commands to combination of key-strokes. Here a "key chord" means two keys pressed simultaneously, or a single key quickly pressed twice.
#+END_QUOTE

The source code can be found on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el][EmacsWiki]].

We need to turn the mode on here so that we can map keys further below. We lower the delay so that chords are not triggered too easily.

#+NAME: gen-keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :results output :tangle no :exports none :colnames nil
  (mapcar (lambda (l)
            (let* ((type (car (last l)))
                   (key (pcase type
                        (`"global"
                         (setq type "global-set-key")
                         (format "(kbd \"%s\")" (car l)))
                        (`"key-chord"
                         (setq type "key-chord-define-global")
                         (format "\"%s\"" (car l)))
                        )))
              (princ (format "(%s %s %s)\n" type key (nth 2 l)))))
          keys)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :results silent
  <<gen-keys()>>
#+END_SRC

The code for the keys is generated from data in an Org table named =keys= using a bit of Elisp code =gen-keys= and is spit out inside a code block via [[http://orgmode.org/manual/noweb.html][Noweb syntax]]. The same data is also used in the [[Keyboard%20shortcuts][Keyboard shortcuts]] section to generate the documentation. I'd like to be able to have only one place to change key information and have it updated wherever necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "C-t") (kbd "C-p"))
  (define-key my-keys-minor-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'helm-mini)
#+END_SRC

=C-t= is translated to =C-p= (move up), this helps me with navigating using the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][Dvorak keyboard layout]].
=my-keys-minor-mode-map= is used to set =C-return= in this case in a way so that other minor modes cannot override it.

*** auto-complete

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Auto-Complete is an intelligent auto-completion extension for Emacs. It extends the standard Emacs completion interface and provides an environment that allows users to concentrate more on their own work.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: Auto-Complete
#+NAME: fig:ac
[[https://raw.github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete/master/doc/ac.png]]

It is written by Tomohiro Matsuyama (aka m2ym). He moved the project from [[http://cx4a.org/][his personal site]] to [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][Github]] a while ago which helped quite a lot with further development.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (setq ac-use-fuzzy t)
  (setq ac-disable-faces nil)
  (setq ac-quick-help-prefer-x nil)
  (setq ac-dwim nil)
#+END_SRC

Initial setup:

- load the default configuration
- lower the menu delay
- show quick help after 1s
- use fuzzy matching

#+END_SRC

Use Emacs' built-in TAB completion hooks to trigger AC (Emacs >= 23.2)

I wanted to be able to get a documentation popup without having to trigger auto-complete. It's mostly stolen from [[http://jaderholm.com/][Scott Jaderholm]]. His code is on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete][Emacswiki]].

*** magit

Magit is the king of Git interaction for Emacs.

There's a short [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit#toc1][Crash Course on Emacswiki]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
- M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
- s to stage files
- c to commit (type in your commit message then C-c C-c to save the message and commit)
- b b to switch to a branch

Other handy keys:

- P P to do a git push
- F F to do a git pull

try to press TAB
#+END_SRC

I have bound =magit-status= to =C-c g= and =magit-log= to =C-c l=.

See the [[http://magit.github.io/magit/magit.html][Magit manual]] for more information.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq magit-commit-all-when-nothing-staged t)
  (when (fboundp 'file-notify-add-watch)
    (add-hook 'magit-status-mode-hook 'magit-filenotify-mode))
#+END_SRC

Committing should act like =git commit -a= by default.

When Emacs has been compiled with inotiy support...

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
./configure --with-file-notification=inotify
#+END_SRC

...the function =file-notify-add-watch= is bound and we add =magit-filenotify-mode= to the hook so that file updates get reflected automatically in magit status.

Provides live interaction with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in a web browser. Expressions are sent on-the-fly from an editing buffer to be evaluated in the browser, just like Emacs does with an inferior Lisp process in Lisp modes.
#+END_QUOTE

The following bookmarklet will load skewer on demand on any website:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  javascript:(function) {
      var d=document;
      var s=d.createElement('script');
      s.src='http://localhost:8080/skewer';
