* Usage

*steckemacs* is an Emacs configuration that integrates around 60 modes (packages). Stock Emacs is not very useful and lacks many convenient commands. Over the years I've discovered many good extensions and added them to this setup. The goal is to keep everything in one file =steckemacs.org= (plus =.emacs= for the initialization) and not as many others to split it over lots of files and directories. Packages are retrieved from the Emacs package repositories on the internet on the first startup.

The source code is hosted on Github: [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs]]

*To use this setup please use Emacs 24.3.50 or later (currently that's the development snapshot). Older versions don't work because I use some of the new features of what is to become Emacs 24.4*

** Installation

Change to a directory of your choice and clone *steckemacs*:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  cd <my directory>
  git clone https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs.git
#+END_SRC

And symlink =.emacs= into your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    cd ~
    ln -s <path to the directory from above>/.emacs
#+END_SRC

That's it. Then you can run emacs and it should pick up the config, install all the packages and make you happy ;)

** How does it work?

I'm using *org-mode* to manage *steckemacs*. =.emacs= (sometimes called *init* file) loads =steckemacs.org=, exports all the code blocks (this process is called "tangling") to =steckemacs.el=. If a block is marked with =:tangle no= it will be skipped. When the tangling is finished =steckemacs.el= is loaded to initialize Emacs.

You can find more information about *Literate Programming* and *org-mode* here: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming

The cool thing about this setup is that you can export the same file as documentation to HTML quite easily. Take a look at the [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs/blob/master/Makefile][Makefile]] to see how this done with a script. To do it from Org mode directly press =C-c C-e=, choose =h= and then one of the options to produce HTML output.

** Keyboard shortcuts

By using the =key-chord= mode we can avoid having to type C- or M- all the time. It allows for using keys pressed simultaneously and I'm using it quite often.

When I write =fg= as a key combo it means you would have to press =f= and =g= at the same time.

I only describe my custom key combinations currently. To learn the standard Emacs commands, go through the Tutorial =C-h t=, use =C-h b= or =M-x= to see/filter the available commands/shortcuts.

#+NAME: keys-doc
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :tangle no :results output raw :exports results

                                (setq category (nth 1 l))
                                (princ (format "*** %s\n" category))
                                (princ "#+ATTR_HTML: :rules all :cellpadding 4\n")
                                (princ "| / | <r> | | \n")
                                )
                              (princ (format "| # | =%s= | %s |\n" (car l) (nth 2 l))))
                          (princ "|-\n")))
            keys))
  (princ "\n")
#+END_SRC

This table is generated with an Elisp block =keys-doc= from an Org table which is also used in the code [[*Key%20Bindings][further below]].

* Code

** Always maximize Emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (modify-all-frames-parameters '((fullscreen . maximized)))
#+END_SRC

This will maximize the current and all future Emacs frames. The parameter has been added in Emacs 24.4

** Load Path

The variable =load-path= lists all the directories where Emacs should look for Elisp files. The first file found is used, therefore the order of the directories is relevant.

=load-path= is documented in the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html][Emacs Online Manual]], in chapter *Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs*. Useful tips are also on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][EmacsWiki]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((default-directory "~/.emacs.d/elisp/"))
    (unless (file-exists-p default-directory)
      (make-directory default-directory))
    (add-to-list 'load-path default-directory))
#+END_SRC

Here we create the directory =~/.emacs.d/elisp= if it does not exist, add it to the =load-path=. Doing that any =.el= or =.elc= files in this directory can be required from *emacs*.

** Online Check

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq stk/onlinep nil)
  (unless
      (condition-case nil
          (delete-process
           (make-network-process
            :name "stk/check-internet"
            :host "elpa.gnu.org"
            :service 80))
        (error t))
    (setq stk/onlinep t))
#+END_SRC

Try to open a connection to =elpa.gnu.org= and if it succeeds set =stk/onlinep= to true. We use this flag later for network related operations.

** El-Get

#+CAPTION: El-Get Logo

[[https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/logo/el-get.png]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
El-Get is designed to simplify this process and allow access to all the various methods of obtaining packages from a single interface. Every package has a recipe that allows you to locate the original source, and that can be updated if the package is moved.
#+END_QUOTE

Dimitri (on the image above, [[fig:dimitri]]) is the clever guy that brougth us El-Get. The code is hosted [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][on Github]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")
  (setq el-get-install-skip-emacswiki-recipes t) (ref:wiki)
  (unless (require 'el-get nil 'noerror)
    (if stk/onlinep
      (with-current-buffer
          (url-retrieve-synchronously
           "https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el")
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (eval-print-last-sexp))
      (error "El-Get is not installed and we are unable to download it without an internet connection: cannot continue")
      ))
#+END_SRC

This sets up the load path and fetches and evaluates the stable El-Get branch if not already loaded (as described [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#basic-setup][on Github]]). In line [[(wiki)]] we make sure El-Get doesn't load all the Wiki recipes as we don't use them.

#+END_SRC

These are simple El-Get recipes that will either fetch single Elisp files or clone a Git repo. The =ob-php= recipe uses a neat El-Get feature that allows to do some preparation after the installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq my-el-get-packages
        (append
         '()
         (mapcar 'el-get-source-name el-get-sources)))

  (el-get 'sync my-el-get-packages)
#+END_SRC

The sync function expects the package names which are extracted from =el-get-sources=. El-Get does the magic and gets the packages specified in =el-get-sources=.

** Packages

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))
#+END_SRC

This adds two remote package repositories. The repo from the FSF is already included in Emacs 24 (see http://elpa.gnu.org/).

[[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] is run by Nic Ferrier who wrote the Emacs webserver [[http://elnode.org/][Elnode]]. Some packages are slightly outdated but it's still a useful resource.

The best repository by far is [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. It builds packages directly from upstream source code. There's a nice [[https://twitter.com/melpa_emacs][Twitter Feed]] showing the packages that have been updated, which is great to discover new modes.

#+END_SRC

Quite a big list of packages. When Emacs starts up the first time it takes quite a while to install all of them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when stk/onlinep
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (cl-loop for p in my-packages
             unless (package-installed-p p)
             do (package-install p)))
#+END_SRC

This part first checks if there is an internet connection. If true it refreshes the package archive cache and goes on to install all the packages that are not yet installed.

** Key Bindings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my-keys-minor-mode-map (make-keymap) "my-keys-minor-mode keymap.")
#+END_SRC

This is a custom keymap. It is used for a [[my-keys-minor-mode][minor mode that is activated at the end]]. This is the only way I know of to make sure no other minor modes to these override special keys. Setting a global key will not suffice.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (key-chord-mode 1)
  (setq key-chord-two-keys-delay 0.03)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Key-chord lets you bind commands to combination of key-strokes. Here a "key chord" means two keys pressed simultaneously, or a single key quickly pressed twice.
#+END_QUOTE

The source code can be found on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el][EmacsWiki]].

We need to turn the mode on here so that we can map keys further below. We lower the delay so that chords are not triggered too easily.

#+NAME: gen-keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :results output :tangle no :exports none :colnames nil
  (mapcar (lambda (l)
            (let* ((key (car l))
                   (def (if (string-match "^[[:alnum:]]\\{2\\}$" (format "%s" key))
                            (format "key-chord-define-global \"%s\"" key)
                          (format "global-set-key (kbd \"%s\")" key)))
                   (command (car (last l))))
                   (princ (format "(%s %s)\n" def command))))
            keys)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :results silent
  <<gen-keys()>>
#+END_SRC

The code for the keys is generated from data in an Org table named =keys= using a bit of Elisp code =gen-keys= and is spit out inside a code block via [[http://orgmode.org/manual/noweb.html][Noweb syntax]]. The same data is also used in the [[Keyboard%20shortcuts][Keyboard shortcuts]] section to generate the documentation. I'd like to be able to have only one place to change key information and have it updated wherever necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "C-t") (kbd "C-p"))
  (define-key my-keys-minor-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'helm-mini)
#+END_SRC

=C-t= is translated to =C-p= (move up), this helps me with navigating using the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][Dvorak keyboard layout]].
=my-keys-minor-mode-map= is used to set =C-return= in this case in a way so that other minor modes cannot override it.

In [[(y-or-n)][line (y-or-n)]] all "yes" or "no" questions are aliased to "y" or "n". We don't really want to type a full word to answer a question from Emacs

Also Emacs should be able to kill processes without asking ([[(process-query)][line (process-query)]]). Got that snippet from: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/11/14/disabling-prompts-emacs/

** Theme, Faces, Frame

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

Loading my very own [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/grandshell-theme][Grand Shell Theme]] here. It can be installed via [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#grandshell-theme][MELPA]]. It looks like this:

#+CAPTION: Grand Shell Theme
#+NAME: grand-shell-theme
[[https://raw.github.com/steckerhalter/grandshell-theme/master/grandshell-theme.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :background "black" :foreground "#babdb6")
#+END_SRC

Use a black background and gray text. To set the default font you can use something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" :height 89)
#+END_SRC

Put that line into =~/.user.el= which is loaded [[*User%20Settings][in this init file too.]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq frame-title-format
        '("" invocation-name " "(:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
                                           (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))
                                         "%b"))))
#+END_SRC

For the frame title either show a file or a buffer name (if the buffer isn't visiting a file).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   '(ansi-color-names-vector
     [("black" . "#8a8888")
      ("#EF3460" . "#F25A7D")
      ("#BDEF34" . "#DCF692")
      ("#EFC334" . "#F6DF92")
      ("#34BDEF" . "#92AAF6")
      ("#B300FF" . "#DF92F6")
      ("#3DD8FF" . "#5AF2CE")
      ("#FFFFFF" . "#FFFFFF")]))
#+END_SRC

For some reason this didn't work with =setq= so I had to use =custom-set-variables=. It changes ansi colors for comint mode, e.g. shell-mode

*** auto-complete

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Auto-Complete is an intelligent auto-completion extension for Emacs. It extends the standard Emacs completion interface and provides an environment that allows users to concentrate more on their own work.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: Auto-Complete
#+NAME: fig:ac
[[http://steckerhalter.co.vu/img/ac.png]]

It is written by Tomohiro Matsuyama (aka m2ym). He moved the project from [[http://cx4a.org/][his personal site]] to [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][Github]] a while ago which helped quite a lot with further development.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'auto-complete-config)
  (ac-config-default)
  (setq ac-auto-show-menu 0.5)
  (setq ac-quick-help-height 50)

  (setq ac-disable-faces nil)
  (setq ac-quick-help-prefer-x nil)
  (setq ac-dwim nil)
#+END_SRC

Initial setup:

- load the default configuration
- lower the menu delay
- show quick help after 1s
- use fuzzy matching

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'pos-tip)
  (defun stk/ac-show-help (ac-doc-function)
    "Show docs for symbol at point or at beginning of list if not on a symbol.

    (interactive)
    (let ((s (symbol-name
              (save-excursion
                (or (symbol-at-point)
                    (progn (backward-up-list)
                           (forward-char)
                           (symbol-at-point)))))))
      (let ((doc-string (funcall ac-doc-function s)))
        (if doc-string
            (if ac-quick-help-prefer-x
                (pos-tip-show doc-string 'popup-tip-face (point) nil -1 60)
              (popup-tip doc-string :point (point)))

    (lambda ()
      (interactive)
      (stk/ac-show-help #'ac-symbol-documentation)))
#+END_SRC

I wanted to be able to get a documentation popup without having to trigger auto-complete. It's mostly stolen from [[http://jaderholm.com/][Scott Jaderholm]] (the code is on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete][Emacswiki]]), but has been made more general to also work with other completion functions.

*** back-button

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Back-button provides an alternative method for navigation by analogy with the "back" button in a web browser.

Every Emacs command which pushes the mark leaves behind an invisible record of the location of the point at that moment. Back-button moves the point back and forth over all the positions where some command pushed the mark.
Visual navigation through mark rings in Emacs.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: back-button

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
CIDER is Clojure IDE and REPL for Emacs, built on top of nREPL, the Clojure networked REPL server. It's a great alternative to the now deprecated combination of SLIME + swank-clojure.
#+END_QUOTE

It was formerly called =nrepl.el= and is written by Bozhidar Batsov.

*** diff-hl

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
diff-hl-mode highlights uncommitted changes on the left side of the window, allows you to jump between and revert them selectively.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (with-current-buffer (current-buffer) (diff-hl-update)))

  (add-hook 'magit-refresh-file-buffer-hook 'stk/diff-hl-update)
#+END_SRC

Turn on the global mode and use the margin (not the fringe) to show the diff. Run =diff-hl-update= via =magit-refresh-file-buffer-hook= (which is run for each buffer after a commit).

*** dired and dired+

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired commands
to operate on the listed files.
#+END_QUOTE

Dired is nice way to browse the directory tree. I have added =dired+= which

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
extends functionalities provided by standard GNU Emacs libraries dired.el, dired-aux.el, and dired-x.el. The standard functions are all available, plus many more.
#+END_QUOTE

See the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus][EmacsWiki]] for detailed information on =dired+=.

Being in a dired buffer it is possible to make the buffer writable and thus rename files and permissions by editing the buffer. Use =C-x C-q= which runs the command =dired-toggle-read-only= to make that possible.

I often use =dired-jump= (mapped to =C-h C-d=) which jumps to Dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq dired-auto-revert-buffer t)
  (toggle-diredp-find-file-reuse-dir 1)
  (setq diredp-hide-details-initially-flag nil)
  (setq diredp-hide-details-propagate-flag nil)
#+END_SRC

It seems that both flags are necessary to make dired+ not hide the details. =toggle-diredp-find-file-reuse-dir= will make sure that there is only one buffer kept around for =dired=. Normally =dired= creates a buffer for every opened directory.

*** elpy

*** grizzl

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Grizzl is a small utility library to be used in other Elisp code needing fuzzy search behaviour. It is optimized for large data sets, using a special type of lookup table and supporting incremental searches (searches where the result can be narrowed-down by only searching what is already matched).
#+END_QUOTE

The source code for Grizzl can be found on [[https://github.com/d11wtq/grizzl][Github]]. It is written by Chris Corbyn who also wrote the PHP REPL =Boris=.

Currently it is used by [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] in my config. I quite like Grizzl. It offers some benefits for when entries are longer. For most cases =IDO= is better suited though.

*** helm

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Helm is incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking for stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).

Helm is a fork of anything.el originaly written by Tamas Patrovic and can be considered to be its successor. Helm sets out to clean up the legacy code in anything.el and provide a cleaner, leaner and more modular tool, that's not tied in the trap of backward compatibility.
#+END_QUOTE

IELM is short for Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode. It is a REPL for Emacs Lisp that is sometimes useful if you want to get immediate feedback and a prompt to work with. I tend to use the =*scratch*= buffer for explorations like that usually but would be probably better off to use IELM more often :)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies(when feasible). For instance - finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find(but for performance sake an indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).

Automatically save place in each file. This means when you visit a file, point goes to the last place
where it was when you previously visited the same file.

Pressing =C-a= once goes back to the indentation, pressing it twice goes the beginning of the line.
Pressing =C-e= once goes back to the end of the line, pressing it twice advances to the next line's indentation.

*** skewer

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Provides live interaction with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in a web browser. Expressions are sent on-the-fly from an editing buffer to be evaluated in the browser, just like Emacs does with an inferior Lisp process in Lisp modes.
