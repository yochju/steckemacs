* Usage

*steckemacs* is an Emacs configuration that integrates around 60 modes (packages). Stock Emacs is not very usable and lacks many convenient commands. Over the years I've discovered many good extensions and added them to this setup. I want to keep everything in one file =steckemacs.org= (plus =.emacs= for the initialization) and not as many others to split it over lots of files and directories. Packages are built directly from source code using [[*Quelpa][quelpa]] (my homegrown tool for this purpose).

The source code is hosted on Github: [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs]]

*To use this setup please use Emacs 24.3.50 or later*

I once thought this could become sort of a [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]] kind of thing but going forward I realized that an Emacs configuration should really just be my (or your) own baby.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
hell is other people's .emacs
#+END_QUOTE

If you want to adapt this setup I suggest that you use it as template and build your own thing out of it :).

** Installation

Change to a directory of your choice and clone *steckemacs*:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cd <my directory>
git clone https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs.git
#+END_SRC

And symlink =.emacs= into your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cd ~
ln -s <path to the directory from above>/.emacs
#+END_SRC

That's it. Then you can run emacs and it should pick up the config, install all the packages and make you happy ;)

** How does it work?

I'm using *org-mode* to manage *steckemacs*. =.emacs= (sometimes called *init* file) loads =steckemacs.org=, exports all the code blocks (this process is called "tangling") to =steckemacs.el=. If a block is marked with =:tangle no= it will be skipped. When the tangling is finished =steckemacs.el= is loaded to initialize Emacs.

You can find more information about *Literate Programming* and *org-mode* here: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming

The cool thing about this setup is that you can export the same file as documentation to HTML quite easily. Take a look at the [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs/blob/master/Makefile][Makefile]] to see how this done with a script. To do it from Org mode directly press =C-c C-e=, choose =h= and then one of the options to produce HTML output.

** Keyboard shortcuts

By using the =key-chord= mode we can avoid having to type C- or M- all the time. It allows for using keys pressed simultaneously and I'm using it quite often.

When I write =fg= as a key combo it means you would have to press =f= and =g= at the same time.

I only describe my custom key combinations currently. To learn the standard Emacs commands, go through the Tutorial =C-h t=, use =C-h b= or =M-x= to see/filter the available commands/shortcuts.

#+NAME: keys-doc
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :tangle no :results output raw :exports results
(let* ((header (car keys))
       (keys (delq header keys))
       (category))
  (pop keys)
  (mapcar (lambda (l) (if (listp l)
                          (progn
                            (unless (string= (nth 1 l) category)
                              (setq category (nth 1 l))
                              (princ (format "*** %s\n" category))
                              (princ "#+ATTR_HTML: :rules all :cellpadding 4\n")
                              (princ "| / | <r> | | \n")
                              )
                            (princ (format "| # | =%s= | %s |\n" (car l) (nth 2 l))))
                        (princ "|-\n")))
          keys))
(princ "\n")
#+END_SRC

This table is generated with an Elisp block =keys-doc= from an Org table which is also used in the code [[*Key%20Bindings][further below]].

* Code

** Always maximize Emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(modify-all-frames-parameters '((fullscreen . maximized)))
#+END_SRC

This will maximize the current and all future Emacs frames. The parameter has been added in Emacs 24.4

** Load Path

The variable =load-path= lists all the directories where Emacs should look for Elisp files. The first file found is used, therefore the order of the directories is relevant.

=load-path= is documented in the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html][Emacs Online Manual]], in chapter *Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs*. Useful tips are also on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][EmacsWiki]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((default-directory "~/.emacs.d/elisp/"))
  (unless (file-exists-p default-directory)
    (make-directory default-directory))
  (add-to-list 'load-path default-directory))
#+END_SRC

Here we create the directory =~/.emacs.d/elisp= if it does not exist, add it to the =load-path=. Doing that any =.el= or =.elc= files in this directory can be required from *emacs*.

** Package Archives

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq package-archives nil)
#+END_SRC

Remove the default GNU package archive since I use =quelpa= to install packages from source.

** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Build and install your Emacs Lisp packages on-the-fly directly from source
#+END_QUOTE

All the packaging solutions that existed annoyed me so I wrote my own and called it =quelpa=.

Given a recipe in [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa#recipe-format][melpa's format]], it gets the package source code, builds an elpa compatible package and installs that. Packages can be managed in the usual way with =list-packages=.

Github: https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (require 'quelpa nil t)
    (quelpa '(quelpa :repo "quelpa/quelpa" :fetcher github) :upgrade t)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (url-insert-file-contents "https://raw.github.com/quelpa/quelpa/master/bootstrap.el")
    (eval-buffer)))
#+END_SRC

Bootstrapping =quelpa= here. The =quelpa= command is used throughout this config to install all the packages.

** Key Bindings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar my-keys-minor-mode-map (make-keymap) "my-keys-minor-mode keymap.")
#+END_SRC

This is a custom keymap. It is used for a [[my-keys-minor-mode][minor mode that is activated at the end]]. This is the only way I know of to protect special combos (like =C-<return>=) from being overridden by other modes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(key-chord :fetcher wiki))
(key-chord-mode 1)
(setq key-chord-two-keys-delay 0.03)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Key-chord lets you bind commands to combination of key-strokes. Here a "key chord" means two keys pressed simultaneously, or a single key quickly pressed twice.
#+END_QUOTE

The source code can be found on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el][EmacsWiki]].

We need to turn the mode on here so that we can map keys further below. We lower the delay so that chords are not triggered too easily.

#+NAME: gen-keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var keys=keys :results output :tangle no :exports none :colnames nil
(mapcar (lambda (l)
          (let* ((key (car l))
                 (def (if (string-match "^[[:alnum:]]\\{2\\}$" (format "%s" key))
                          (format "key-chord-define-global \"%s\"" key)
                        (format "global-set-key (kbd \"%s\")" key)))
                 (command (car (last l))))
                 (princ (format "(%s %s)\n" def command))))
          keys)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :results silent
<<gen-keys()>>
#+END_SRC

The code for the keys is generated from data in an Org table named =keys= using a bit of Elisp code =gen-keys= and is spit out inside a code block via [[http://orgmode.org/manual/noweb.html][Noweb syntax]]. The same data is also used in the [[Keyboard%20shortcuts][Keyboard shortcuts]] section to generate the documentation. I'd like to be able to have only one place to change key information and have it updated wherever necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key my-keys-minor-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'helm-mini)
#+END_SRC

=my-keys-minor-mode-map= is used to set =C-return= in this case in a way so that other minor modes cannot override it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

This is kind of random stuff. I would like to organize this better but I didn't have a good idea for that yet.

*** Default Settings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 tab-width 4
 indent-tabs-mode nil                   ;use spaces instead of tabs
 c-basic-offset 4                       ;"tab" with in c-related modes
 c-hungry-delete-key t                  ;delete more than one space
 )
#+END_SRC

Some variables like =tab-width= cannot be set globally:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
tab-width is a variable defined in `C source code'.
...
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.
#+END_QUOTE

Whenever they are set the value becomes buffer-local. To be able to set such a variable globally we have to use =setq-default= which modifies the default value of the variable.

*** Global Modes

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)  ;auto revert buffers when changed on disk
(show-paren-mode t)          ;visualize()
(iswitchb-mode t)            ;use advanced tab switching
(blink-cursor-mode -1)       ;no cursor blinking
(tool-bar-mode -1)           ;disable the awful toolbar
(menu-bar-mode -1)           ;no menu, you can toggle it with C-c m
(scroll-bar-mode -1)         ;disable the sroll bar
#+END_SRC

These are built-in global modes/settings. Not sure where to put them so they ended up here...

*** Prompt Behavior

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

(setq kill-buffer-query-functions
  (remq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function
         kill-buffer-query-functions))
#+END_SRC

All "yes" or "no" questions are aliased to "y" or "n". We don't really want to type a full word to answer a question from Emacs, yet Emacs imposes that silly behavior on us. No!

Also Emacs should be able to kill processes without asking which is achieved in the second expression. Got that snippet from: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/11/14/disabling-prompts-emacs/

** Theme, Faces, Frame

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(grandshell-theme :repo "steckerhalter/grandshell-theme" :fetcher github))
(load-theme 'grandshell t)
#+END_SRC

Loading my very own [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/grandshell-theme][Grand Shell Theme]] here. It can be installed via [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#grandshell-theme][MELPA]] too. It looks like this:

#+CAPTION: Grand Shell Theme
#+NAME: grand-shell-theme
[[https://raw.github.com/steckerhalter/grandshell-theme/master/grandshell-theme.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" :height 89)
#+END_SRC

I put that line into =~/.user.el= which is loaded [[*User%20Settings][in this init file too.]] To avoid getting this line into the config I use =:tangle no= as an option in the org-mode source block header.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-after-make-frame (frame)
  (when (find-font (font-spec :name "Symbola") frame)
    (dolist (range '((#x2600 . #x26ff)
                     (#x1f300 . #x1f5ff)
                     (#x1f600 . #x1f640)
                     (#x1f680 . #x1f6ff)))
      (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" range "Symbola"))))
(add-to-list 'after-make-frame-functions 'my-after-make-frame)
#+END_SRC

This will set =Symbola= as fallback-font for Emojis when it is available for the created frame. On Debian the font can be installed like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script :tangle no
sudo aptitude install ttf-ancient-fonts
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '((:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
                   (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))
                 "%b"))))
#+END_SRC

For the frame title either show a file or a buffer name (if the buffer isn't visiting a file).

** Custom Functions
*** my-indent-whole-buffer

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-indent-whole-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)))
#+END_SRC

Indent the whole buffer with one command. Bound to =C-h TAB=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook 'my-isearch-goto-match-beginning)
#+END_SRC

Make =isearch-forward= put the cursor at the start of the search, not the end, so that isearch can be used for navigation. See also http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IsearchOtherEnd.

*** my-show-file-name

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-show-file-name ()
  "Show the full path file name in the minibuffer."

  (lambda ()

#+END_SRC

I wanted to be able to get a documentation popup without having to trigger auto-complete. It's mostly stolen from [[http://jaderholm.com/][Scott Jaderholm]] (the code is on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete][Emacswiki]]), but has been made more general to also work with other completion functions.

*** my-split-window

It comes with several back-ends such as Elisp, Clang, Semantic, Eclim, Ropemacs, Ispell, dabbrev, etags, gtags, files, keywords and a few others.

I started using =company= because =auto-complete= seemed to be buggy and slow. Some of the company features are pretty cool, for example the ability to search within completions with =C-s= or to show the symbol definition with =C-w=. =<f1>= shows the full documentation of a symbol. I miss the popup from auto-complete a bit but I guess that's not so important in the end.

For Elisp add code dabbrev as second company source so that not only interned symbols can be completed, but also what was just written (and not yet evaluated).

*** dedicated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This minor mode allows you to toggle a window's "dedicated" flag. When a window is "dedicated", Emacs will not select files into that window. This can be quite handy since many commands will use another window to show results (e.g., compilation mode, starting info, etc.) A dedicated window won't be used for such a purpose.

*** dired and dired+

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired commands
to operate on the listed files.
#+END_QUOTE

Dired is nice way to browse the directory tree. I have added =dired+= which

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
extends functionalities provided by standard GNU Emacs libraries dired.el, dired-aux.el, and dired-x.el. The standard functions are all available, plus many more.
#+END_QUOTE

http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/DrewsEmacsDiredLine.jpg

See the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus][EmacsWiki]] for detailed information on =dired+=.

Being in a dired buffer it is possible to make the buffer writable and thus rename files and permissions by editing the buffer. Use =C-x C-q= which runs the command =dired-toggle-read-only= to make that possible.

I often use =dired-jump= (mapped to =C-h C-d=) which jumps to Dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(dired+ :fetcher wiki))

(toggle-diredp-find-file-reuse-dir 1)
(setq diredp-hide-details-initially-flag nil)
(setq diredp-hide-details-propagate-flag nil)
#+END_SRC

It seems that both flags are necessary to make dired+ not hide the details. =toggle-diredp-find-file-reuse-dir= will make sure that there is only one buffer kept around for =dired=. Normally =dired= creates a buffer for every opened directory.

*** magit

Magit is the king of Git interaction for Emacs.

http://www.masteringemacs.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2013-12-06-142317.png

There's a short [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit#toc1][Crash Course on Emacswiki]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
- M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
- s to stage files
- c to commit (type in your commit message then C-c C-c to save the message and commit)
- b b to switch to a branch

Other handy keys:

- P P to do a git push
- F F to do a git pull

try to press TAB
#+END_SRC

I have bound =magit-status= to =C-c g= and =magit-log= to =C-c l=.

See the [[http://magit.github.io/magit/magit.html][Magit manual]] for more information.

Committing should act like =git commit -a= by default.

When Emacs has been compiled with inotiy support...

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script

...the function =file-notify-add-watch= is bound and we add =magit-filenotify-mode= to the hook so that file updates get reflected automatically in magit status.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies(when feasible). For instance - finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find(but for performance sake an indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).

*** term-mode

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The =Emacs Terminal Emulator= uses Term mode, which has two input modes.  In line mode, Term basically acts like Shell mode.  In char mode, each character is sent directly to the subshell, except for the Term escape character, normally ‘C-c’.

I'd like to have the terminal respect the default keys of the shell as much as possible hence I remap the non-standard bindings to the defaults. Furthermore I want to switch between Emacs-style navigation (term-line-mode) and raw terminal input (term-char-mode) quickly.

*** zoom-frm

Another library written by Drew Adams.

Code: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/zoom-frm.el

What I usually want is to have Emacs increase or decrease the text size for the whole frame (with mode-line and mini-buffer). There is nothing built in that can do that so I use this library.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
